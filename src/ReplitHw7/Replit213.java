        /*
        ** this file should contain student lesson instructions **

_ students will see these instructions in a read-only workspace tab _

Steps
Use Markdown to format your instructions.

For example, here is a code block in java10_beta

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("hello world");
  }
}
Include an image by placing it in the assets folder.

For example, here is the Replit logo:

alt text

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int temperature = 30;
                if (temperature < 32) {
                    System.out.println(new RuntimeException("It is freezing"));
                }
            }
        }
